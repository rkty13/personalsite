                <p class="desc">hackBCA is one of the largest student run high school hackathons in the nation. I was in charge of managing all front end work necessary for the entire site and any other technical needs. This included all backend staff tools and all other static pages. I also helped write much of the backend as well. Aside from technical tasks, I also worked with all of the other board members to organize the entire event as a whole. I helped contact sponsors, mentors, and decide on food as well as other logistical matters. During the event, I was in charge of making sure the checking in and out process went smoothly.</p>

                <p class="desc">As a Web Development Intern, I worked closely with the website developers as well as the designer to update and maintain the Black Lapel website. I also created new redesigned webpages from photoshop mockups. I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, as well as many web design principles and development practices. I also learned about basic online marketing through the use of Optimizely and helped the Black Lapel team to track user behavior at important processes on their site. </p>
